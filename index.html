Why, hello there! I'm your host, Nick. As you may have guessed, I write apps. Feel free to peruse some of my current applications below. If you see anything that piques your curiosity, you can click the "Purchase From App Store" link to purchase the application.
</p>

<p class="c">
Each of these products were painstakingly tested for quality by my wife and five children.
</p>

<p class="c">
If you already own one of these applications, I'd appreciate your <a href="#feedback">feedback</a>. I'm always interested in improving the quality of my products, and the easiest route to improvement is through feedback from the users.
</p>

<p class="c">
Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy my products.

Clax is a strategy puzzle game in which you remove groups of colored balls in a way that ultimately allows you to clear the board of all balls.
</p>

<p class="c">
Clax has 6 difficulties, 2 ball sizes and a system to track and view your high scores.
</p>

<p class="c">
Be cautioned, this game is extremely addicting. Like, addictive as <em>crack</em>, but at a fraction of the cost. I'm sure my wife has logged more hours playing this game than she has driving our car!

<p class="c">
Whether you want to impress your alpha friends or just confuse all of your normal buddies, a binary clock is a sure fire way to achieve your goal.
</p>

<p class="c">
As you may have guessed, this simple clock uses binary to display the current time down to the second, with a hypnotic tick-tock sound to back the purple and cyan dots. No preferences, no frills. Great utility to satisfy the geek in all of us!
</p>

<p class="c">
Also worth noting is that the methodic ticking and color changing has the ability to keep babies and toddlers enthralled for hours.
